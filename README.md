Real-Time Face Recognition and Facial Attribute Analysis in Python: Detecting Age, Gender, and Emotion


Real-Time Face Recognition and Facial Attribute Analysis in Python: Detecting Age, Gender, and Emotion is an implementation of facial recognition, and detection of facial attributes (age, gender, emotion, and race) for Python. The repository provides a script to run Face Info with the webcam or by entering the path of an image. This implementation allows the recognition of multiple faces and the registration of new users for facial recognition.
